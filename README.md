*Monolithic Contact List*

This theory exercise is mainly based on the E.01.02.01.01, in which we will be developing a monolithic contact list with slight differences resulting from our design. 

This exercise will be based on the unified process development, UPD, and we will be using a multilayered architecture software development (presentation, domain and persistence).
